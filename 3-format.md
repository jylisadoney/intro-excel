# Part Two: Format and Sort Data

After we've organized our spreadsheet, we can work on formatting our data.

## Format dates
In Excel, dates are easier to organize and sort when they are represented numerically.

Let's fix our `Hire Date` column to make it more readable.
* Left click on `Column E`
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Number` section
* Left click on the `Number Format Icon`
* Left click on `Date` under Category
* Scroll down and left click on `3/14/2012`
* Click `OK`

We can now see that our `Hire Date` column is better organized and our dates are represented by numbers.

## Format currency
We can also format our `Sales Q1` and `Sales Q2` columns so that the data is displayed as Currency.

To do this:
* Left click on `Column C` and drag to highlight `Column D`
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Number` section
* Left click on the `Drop-Down` box
* Left click on `Currency`

## Sort data
Now let’s say we want to organize our sheet based on when an employee joined the company.

To do this:
* Highlight all of the data
  * Option 1: Left click on `Cell A1` and drag
  * Option 2: Hold down `Ctrl A` on your keyboard
* Navigate to the `Data` tab and the `Sort & Filter` section
* Left click on `Sort`
* Check the ‘My data has headers’ box
* In the Sort by drop-down box, left click on `Hire Date`
  * Set the sort On drop-down box to `Values`
  * Set the order drop-down box to `Oldest to Newest`
* Left click on `OK`

Now the data in our sheet is sorted based on Hire Date.
