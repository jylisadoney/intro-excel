# Part Two: Format and Sort Data

After we've organized our spreadsheet, we can work on formatting our data.

# Format dates
In Excel, dates are easier to organize and sort when they are represented numerically.

Let's fix our `Hire Date` column to make it more readable.

* Navigate to the `Employee Sales` sheet (or Sheet1)
* Click on `Column E`
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Number` section
* Click on the arrow in the bottom right of the `Number` section
* Under Category, click on `Date`
* Scroll down and click on `3/14/2012`
* Click `OK`

The dates in the `Hire Date` columns are now represented by numbers.

# Format currency
We can also format our `Sales Q1` and `Sales Q2` columns so that the data are displayed as Currency.
* Click on `Column C`
* Drag to highlight `Column D` (both Columns should now be highlighted)
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Number` section
* Click on the Drop-Down box
* Click on `Currency`

The data in our `Sales Q1` and `Sales Q2` columns are now formatted as currency.

# Sort data
Now letâ€™s say we want to organize our sheet based on `when an employee joined the company`.
* Highlight all of the data
  * Option 1: Click on `Cell A1` and drag to highlight all data **OR**
  * Option 2: Hit `Ctrl A` on your keyboard
* Navigate to the `Data` tab and the `Sort & Filter` section
* Slick on `Sort`
* Check the `My data has headers` box
* In the `Sort by` drop-down box, click on `Hire Date`
  * Set the `Sort on` drop-down box to `Values`
  * Set the `Order` drop-down box to `Oldest to Newest`
* Click on `OK`

Now the data in our sheet is sorted based on Hire Date. We could also sort `Hire Date` as `Newest to Oldest`.
