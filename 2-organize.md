# Part One: Organize Spreadsheets

When working in Excel workbooks, we often need to organize our sheet to make the data readable and visually appealing.

## Resize columns and rows
If you encounter columns or rows that are too big or too small, you can always resize them.

### Autofit
* Left click on `Column A` to highlight it
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Cells` section
* Left click on `Format`
* Left click on `Autofit Column Width`
  * You can also enter in a width or height value using `Row Height` or `Column Width`

### Drag to resize
* Hover your cursor between `Column B` and `Column C`
  * You should see a cursor that is a **vertical line with two arrows**
* Left click and `drag the column boundary` to the width you want

## Rename a column header
Sometimes when working with data, we need to rename our column headers.

Let's say we want to rename `Column B` to `Employees`.
* Left click on `Cell B1`  
* Type the word `Employees`

## Freeze panes
Right now, our sheet only includes 10 rows. However, if you have a spreadsheet with hundreds of rows or columns it can be difficult to keep your column headings visible.

What we can do is `freeze panes` to keep part of the sheet visible when we scroll.

### Freeze the top rows
* Navigate to the `View` tab
* Left click the `Freeze Panes` icon
* Left click on `Freeze Top Row`

### Freeze a column and row at the same time
* Left click on `Cell C2`
* Navigate to the `View` tab
* Left click the `Freeze Panes` icon
* Left click on `Freeze Panes` again

### Unfreeze panes
* Left click the `Freeze Panes` icon
* Click on `Unfreeze Panes`

## Insert, delete, and rename sheets
Depending on the data you are working with, you may have or need multiple `sheets` in your `workbook`.

### Insert a sheet
 * Left click the `plus (+) button` at the bottom of the workbook
 
### Delete a sheet
* Right click on the sheet name
* Left click on `Delete`
  * **Caution!** This will delete ALL data included in that sheet

## Rename a sheet
Right now, our sheet is named Sheet1. Let's rename it to something more descriptive.

* Left click on `Sheet1`
* Right click on `Sheet1`
* Left click on `Rename`
* Type `Employee Sales`
  * Left click somewhere in your workbook to save this rename
