# Tips and Tricks

Excel offers lots of other ways to organize your spreadsheets and work with your data.

## Split text into multiple columns

Let’s say we want to separate our employee’s first and last names in the `Salesperson` column.

To do this, navigate to the `Tips` sheet in our workbook.

Our first step is to insert a new column to the left of `Sales Q1 (Column C)`.
* Click on `Column C`
* Right click then click on `Insert`

Then, navigate to the `Data` tab and `Data Tools` section
* Click on `Column B` to highlight it
* Click on `Text to Columns`
* Select the `Delimited` option in the pop-up window
* Click `Next`
* Click `Tab` to uncheck the box
* Click to check the box for `Space`
  * We can now see a preview of what our data will look like
* Click `Next`
* Click `Finish`

Now, since we have two columns with employee names, let's rename `Column B` and `Column C`.
* Click `Cell B1` and rename it to `Employee First Name`
* Click `Cell C1` and rename it to `Employee Last Name`

We can also `resize the columns` if we need to.
* Click and highlight both `Column B and Column C`
* Navigate to the `Home tab` and `Cells` section
* Click on `Format`
* Click on `Autofit Column Width`

## Wrap text
If your data is text-based, you can `wrap the text` so it appears on multiple lines in a cell.
* Click to highlight the cell, column, or row where you want to wrap text
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and `Alignment` section
* Click on `Wrap Text`

## Add today's date
* Click on the cell where you want the date to appear
* Hit `Ctrl ;` on your keyboard (same for Mac users)
