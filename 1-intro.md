# Key Terminology and Naming Files

## Terminology

Learning Excel is kind of like learning a new language.

An entire Excel file is called a `workbook` and every workbook includes `sheets`. 

When you open a new Excel file, Sheet1 is automatically created at the bottom of the workbook. 

`Excel workbooks can have multiple sheets.`

The data in Excel workbooks are organized into `columns` and `rows`. 

The intersection between a column and a row is a `cell`.

`Tabs` appear at the top of the workbook and help you utilize many Excel features, such as creating charts and graphs or sorting your data.

The `formula bar` is where you can see the formulas and functions you've inserted into certain cells.

## Naming Files

It is important to save, name, and version an Excel workbook so it is easy to find in the future.

### File names
In your file names, consider including:
* Assignment or project names
* Your name or initials
* Date of last edit
* Version numbers
* Geographic coordinates
* Type of data, etc.

`For example: SOC320_SMM_20180205_v001`

### Characters
Spaces don't work well in file names, but you can use `underscores (_)` or `dashes (-)` instead. 

Special characters should also be avoided: `~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " |`.

### Dates
To make sure your files stay in chronological order, insert dates as `YYYYMMDD`.

### Versioning
Consider using `leading zeros` (001, 002 ... 010 ... 100) for version numbers so files sort in numeric order.

### Consistency
Finally, keep your file naming as consistent as possible within the same assignment or project.
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v001
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v002
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v010

## Practice: Rename our sample workbook
* Left click `File` then `Save As`
* Browse to find a location to save the workbook
* Rename the file and add:
  * Your name or initials
  * Today's date
  * A version number
* Left click `Save`
