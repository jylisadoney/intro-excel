# Create Charts and Graphs

Not only can Excel help you organize data and information, it can also help you create charts and graphs to visually share your data.

Today, we are going to focus on creating a `Bar Chart` that compares each employee's sales in Q1 and Q2.

## Create a bar chart

First, let's navigate to the `Charts` sheet in our workbook.

Our first step is to:
* Highlight all of our data
  * Left click on `Cell A1` and drag to highlight all data **OR**
  * Hit `Ctrl A` on your keyboard

We can now work on creating our chart.
* Navigate to the `Insert` tab
* Left click the picture of the `Bar Chart`
* Left click `2-D Clustered Column` (option 1)

Right away, we see that this chart is a **mess** and the visualization is confusing -- but we can fix it!

## Edit the data in a bar chart

Since we only want to compare sales from Q1 and Q2, we aren't interested in the Total Sales or the Hire Date.

To remove the Total Sales data from our chart:
* Left click on the chart
* Left click on the `Funnel Icon`
* Under `Series`, left click on `Total Sales` and `Hire Date` to uncheck the boxes
* Left click on `Apply`

Our chart is looking much better - but including the state names in our chart makes it difficult to read.

To remove the State Names:
* Left on the chart
* Left click on the `Funnel Icon`
* Left click on `Names` to uncheck the box
* Under `Categories`, select the option for `Column B`
* Left click on `Apply`

After these two small changes, our chart looks so much better!

Another important piece of visualizations is adding text that describes the data.

## Add a chart title

To add a chart title:
* Left click on the chart 
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Left click on `Chart Title`
* Type a title that describes this data
  * Maybe something like `Employee Sales by Quarter`

## Add titles to our axes

To add a title to our horizontal axis (x-axis):
* Left click on the chart
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Left click on `Add Chart Element`
* Hover over `Axis Titles`
* Left click on `Horizontal Axis`

We now have a text box that we can use to describe this axis.

To edit the text:
* Left click on the chart
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Left click on `Horizontal Axis`
* Type a word or phrase that describes this axis
  * Maybe something like `Employee Names`

## Position the chart legend

To position our chart legend from the default location:
* Left click on the chart
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Left click on `Add Chart Element`
* Hover over `Legend`
* Left click on `Right`

Our legend is now positioned to the `right` of our `bar chart`.
