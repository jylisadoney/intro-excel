# Create Charts and Graphs

Not only can Excel help you organize data and information, it can also help you create charts and graphs to visually share your data.

Today, we will create a `Bar Chart` that compares each employee's sales in Q1 and Q2.

## Create a bar chart

First, let's navigate to the `Charts` sheet in our workbook.
* Highlight all of our data
  * Option 1: Click on `Cell A1` and drag to highlight all data **OR**
  * Option 2: Hit `Ctrl A` on your keyboard (`Command A` for Mac users)

We can now work on creating our chart.
* Navigate to the `Insert` tab
* Click the picture of the `Bar Chart`
* Click `2-D Clustered Column` (option 1)

Right away, we see that this chart is a **mess** and the visualization is confusing -- but we can fix it!

## Edit the data in a bar chart

Since we only want to compare `sales in Q1 and Q2`, we aren't interested in Total Sales or Hire Date.

To remove the `Total Sales` and `Hire Dates` from our chart:
* Click on the chart
* Click on the `Funnel Icon`
* Under `Series`, click on `Total Sales` and `Hire Date` to uncheck the boxes
* Click on `Apply`

Our chart is looking much better - but including the state office names in our chart makes it difficult to read.

To remove `State Office` names from our chart:
* Click on the chart
* Click on the `Funnel Icon`
* Click on `Names`
* Under `Categories`, select the option for `Column B`
* Click on `Apply`

After these two small changes, our chart looks so much better!

# Describe the data
Another important part of creating visualizations is to add text that describes the data.

## Add a chart title
* Click on the chart 
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Click on `Chart Title`
* Type a title that describes the data
  * Maybe something like `Employee Sales by Quarter`

## Position the chart legend
* Click on the chart
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Click on `Add Chart Element`
* Hover over `Legend`
* Click on `Right`

Our legend is now positioned to the `right` of our `bar chart`.

## Add a title to the horizontal axis (x-axis)
* Click on the chart
* Navigate to the `Design` tab
* Click on `Add Chart Element`
* Hover over `Axis Titles`
* Click on `Primary Horizontal`

We now have a text box that we can use to describe this axis.

To edit the text:
* Click on the chart
* Click on the `Axis Title`
* Type a word or phrase that describes this axis
  * Maybe something like `Employee Names`

You can use the same steps to add a title to the `Primary Vertical axis`.
