# Additional Excel Features

Excel offers many other functions that you can use to work with your data.

## Templates

If you tend to use the same layout in Excel workbooks, you can save it as a `template` and use it again in the future.

### Set the default personal templates location
* Left click `File` then `Options`
* Left click on the `Save` tab
* Navigate to the `Save workbooks` section
* Type this file path: `C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Custom Office Templates`
  * Replace [User Name] with your user name
* Left click `OK`

All templates you save to the `My Templates` folder will now appear as options when you create a new Excel workbook

### Save a workbook as a template
* Open the workbook you want to save as a template
* Left click `File` then `Export`
* Under `Export`, left click `Change File Type`
* Under the `Workbook File Types` section, double-click on `Template`
* Type the file name you want to use for the template
* Left click `Save` and close the template

### Create a workbook based on a template
* Open Excel
* Left click `File` then `New`
* Left click `Personal`
* Double-click the template you want to use

Excel will then create a new workbook based on this template.
