# Key terminology

An entire Excel file is called a `workbook` and every workbook includes one or more `sheets`. 

When you open a new Excel file, `Sheet1` is automatically created at the bottom of the workbook. 

The data in Excel workbooks are organized into `columns` and `rows`. 

The intersection between a column and a row is a `cell`.

`Tabs` appear at the top of the workbook and help you utilize many Excel features, such as creating charts and graphs or sorting your data.

The `formula bar` is where you can see the formulas and functions you've inserted into certain cells.

# Naming Files

It is important to save, name, and version an Excel workbook so it is easy to find in the future.

## File names
In your file names, consider including:
* Assignment or project names
* Your name or initials
* Date of last edit
* Version numbers
* Geographic coordinates
* Type of data, etc.

`For example: SOC320_SMM_20180205_v001`

## Characters
Spaces don't work well in file names, but you can use `underscores (_)` or `dashes (-)` instead. 

Special characters should also be avoided: `~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " |`.

## Dates
To make sure your files stay in chronological order, insert dates as `YYYYMMDD`.

## Versioning
Consider using `leading zeros` (001, 002 ... 010 ... 100) for version numbers so files sort in numeric order.

## Consistency
Finally, keep your file naming as consistent as possible within the same assignment or project.
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v001
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v002
* SOC320_SMM_20180205_v010
