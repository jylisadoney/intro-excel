# Part One: Organize Spreadsheets

When working in Excel workbooks, we often need to organize our sheet to make the data readable and visually appealing.

## Resize columns and rows
If you encounter columns or rows that are too big or too small, you can always resize them.

Let's work on resizing two columns.

### Autofit
* Left click on `Column A` to highlight it
* Navigate to the `Home` tab and the `Cells` section
* Left click on `Format`
* Select `Autofit Column Width`
  * Can also enter in a width or height value using `Row Height` or `Column Width`

### Drag a boundary
* Hover your cursor between `Column B` and `Column C` until you get the **vertical line with two arrows** cursor
* Left click and `drag the column boundary` column to the width you want

## Wrap text

## Rename a column header
Sometimes when working with data, we need to rename our column headers.

Let's say we want to rename `Column B` to `Employees`.

To do this, simply click on `Cell B1` and type the word **Employees**.

## Freeze panes
Right now, our sheet only includes 10 rows. However, if you have a spreadsheet with hundreds of rows or columns, it can be difficult to keep your column headings visible.

What we can do is `Freeze Panes` to keep part of the sheet visible when we scroll.

Let's work on two different ways of freezing panes.

### Freeze the top rows
* Navigate to the `View` tab
* Left click on `Freeze Panes`
* Select `Freeze Top Row`

### Freeze a column and row at the same time
* Left click on `Cell C2`
* Navigate to the `View` tab
* Left click on `Freeze Panes`
* Select `Freeze Panes`

### Unfreeze panes
To unfreeze panes, left click on `Freeze Panes` again and click `Unfreeze Panes`.

## Insert, delete, and rename sheets
Depending on the data you are working with, you may have multiple `sheets` in your `workbook`

* To `insert a sheet`
  * Left click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the 
* To `delete a sheet`
  * Right click on the sheet name and left click `Delete`
  * **Caution!** This will delete ALL data included in that sheet

Let's practice renaming a sheet.
* Left click on `Sheet1`
* Right click on `Sheet1`
* Left click on `Rename`
* Type `Employee Sales`
  * Left click somewhere in your workbook to save this rename
